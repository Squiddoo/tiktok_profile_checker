# tiktok_profile_checker
# [OUTDATED]
I made this 'tiktok profile checker' to improve my python skills. 

How To Use:
* Open 'tiktok_profile_checker's code.
* Go to line 8 and replace the 'path' with the path to your chromedriver.exe
* save & close
* Open 'tiktok_profile_checker' and enter the username you want to get data from.
* If it crashes it means the user is unavailable or something went wrong!
